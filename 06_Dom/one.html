<!-- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a structured way for web browsers to represent and interact with HTML pages, treating every part of a page (like tags, text, and attributes) as objects.(It's how JavaScript “talks” to HTML.) -->



<!--The DOM is explained as a model that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects (head, body, p, img ). Every element, attribute, and text is considered a "node" in this tree

    Example HTML:
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>Paragraph</p>
    </body>
    </html>
  Corresponding DOM Tree:
    Document
    └── html
        └── body
            ├── h1
            │    └── "Hello"
            └── p
                └── "Paragraph"
 -->


<!-- # Window and Document :- -->


<!-- -The browser creates a window object that represents the browser tab or window. -->


 <!-- -window contains many properties and methods — one of them is document. -->


<!-- -The document object represents the webpage and provides access to: -->


    <!-- HTML elements. -->
    <!-- Document structure. -->
    <!-- Methods for DOM manipulation. -->

    <!-- console.log(window.document); // Outputs the entire HTML document and methods for manipulation -->
    <!-- console.log(document); //outputs entire document -->
    <!-- console.dir(windows); //Outputs the entire HTML document and methods for manipulation -->


<!-- !! Collections like HTMLCollection or NodeList are used to handle groups of elements, but they differ from standard arrays. -->

<!--  DOM[All Document elements are objects in javascript] 
    window is a global object which contains document object
     console.dir(document) gives the document object as it is
     document.baseURI - give the base url
     document.getElementById() - used to select the element with id

    targeting the elements [elements ko catch karna]
     document.getElementByClassName() //returns HTML collection

     element.className - gives the class name [used in react]
     element.id = gives the id
     element.getAttribute('att_name')
     element.setAttribute('att_name','att_value') - overwrites the pre-existing attribute
     element.style.color = 'red'

     element.textContent =  gives the display:none element too
     element.innerText = does not give the display:none elements
     element.innerHTML = gives the html too

     element.querySelector('any') = it can take any selector like we give in css
     We can also use querySelector or any selecting method on any element which contains some child nodes
     We can use forEach on NodeList which comes from querySelectorAll()
     NODELIST AND HTML COLLECTION are not pure arrays but nodelist has forEach() method
     Html collection do not have forEach() so it needs to be converted to array first
     Both nodelist & htmlcollection can be converted into array by using Array.from(nodeList/HtmlCollection) -->
